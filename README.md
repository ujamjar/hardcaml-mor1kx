# OpenRISC 1200 CPU

This is a port of the _mor1kx_ OpenRISC 1200 implementation to HardCaml.

The initial aim is a pretty direct port of the RTL.  Later we can try to
make the code a bit more idiomatic.

# License

The original code is covered by the _Open-Hardware-Description-License_.
This port is also covered by that license.
